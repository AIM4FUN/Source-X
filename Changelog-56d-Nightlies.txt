Changed: Food level won't decrease on GM chars anymore.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed messages 'npc_text_murd_*'.
[sphere_speech.scp]: Moved hardcoded speech commands 'I must consider my sins', 'I resign from my guild' and 'I resign from my town' to scripts.
	-IMPORTANT: It's HIGHLY recommended update this script, or these speech commands will stop working.

Removed TAG.OVERRIDE.MAXWEIGHT and added ModMaxWeight on it's place for Banks and Corpses.
Fixed stackable items not checking maxweight on corpses.
Removed all references to MEMORY_WAR_TARG since they are not needed anymore, targets are handled by 'Attacker' now.
Added back old HitChance formula under CombatDamageEra = 0
Updated checks on @NotoSend trigger: it will not check anymore if ARGN1 > NOTO_INVUL, so you can create custom notoriety.

Fixed: Protection spell not working correctly if COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE combat flag is disabled.

Fixed: Pets not gaining Karma (it can be blocked through @KarmaChange trigger, no reason to stop it from the source).
Fixed: Killing pets and/or bonded pets not giving karma (same reason as above).
Fixed: Hits being canceled when going out of range and COMBAT_STAYINRANGE was enabled, it should happen when it is disabled.
Fixed: Attack delay broken when COMBAT_PREHIT is disabled because of using as SetTimeOut animDelay instead of iSwingDelay.
Fixed: Weird crash related to a change on CChar:OnTick() (Not really fixed, just reverted the code because I couldn't track what is exactly causing it and seems to happen when there are ~100 clients online, so I'm not going to mess a lot with it, it's not cool to use 100 players to do tests :) ).
Attempt to log and stop a crash related to the NetworkOutput.
Fixed NPC_FightMagery not correctly checking if the NPC can use magic skills and creating some infinite loops under certain circumstances.
