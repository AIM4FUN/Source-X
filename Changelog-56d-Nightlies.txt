Changed: Food level won't decrease on GM chars anymore.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed messages 'npc_text_murd_*'.
[sphere_speech.scp]: Moved hardcoded speech commands 'I must consider my sins', 'I resign from my guild' and 'I resign from my town' to scripts.
	-IMPORTANT: It's HIGHLY recommended update this script, or these speech commands will stop working.

Removed TAG.OVERRIDE.MAXWEIGHT and added ModMaxWeight on it's place for Banks and Corpses.
Fixed stackable items not checking maxweight on corpses.
Removed all references to MEMORY_WAR_TARG since they are not needed anymore, targets are handled by 'Attacker' now.
Added back old HitChance formula under CombatDamageEra = 0
Updated checks on @NotoSend trigger: it will not check anymore if ARGN1 > NOTO_INVUL, so you can create custom notoriety.

Fixed: Protection spell not working correctly if COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE combat flag is disabled.

Fixed: Pets not gaining Karma (it can be blocked through @KarmaChange trigger, no reason to stop it from the source).
Fixed: Killing pets and/or bonded pets not giving karma (same reason as above).
Fixed: Hits being canceled when going out of range and COMBAT_STAYINRANGE was enabled, it should happen when it is disabled.
Fixed: Attack delay broken when COMBAT_PREHIT is disabled because of using as SetTimeOut animDelay instead of iSwingDelay.
Fixed: Weird crash related to a change on CChar:OnTick() (Not really fixed, just reverted the code because I couldn't track what is exactly causing it and seems to happen when there are ~100 clients online, so I'm not going to mess a lot with it, it's not cool to use 100 players to do tests :) ).
Attempt to log and stop a crash related to the NetworkOutput.
Fixed: NPC_FightMagery not correctly checking if the NPC can use magic skills and creating some infinite loops under certain circumstances.

Updated Fight_IsActive function with NPC's skills and one Attacker's check.
Fixed: NPCs not ending combat when their target is far away from them and calling Attacker_Delete() @CombatDelete with argn=2 (Distance) to give control over it.
Fixed: GUARD ME making pet following you instead of guarding you (Thanks Shamino).
Fixed: NPCs being dumb before they reach their target.
Updated a bit CChar::OnTick.

Fixed: speech color for NPCs on Enhanced Clients being always "yellow". Achieved this by forcing (only for EC) system (0) talkmode instead of say (3).
	This workaround works only if the speech packet sent by Sphere is Unicode (instead of ASCII), so you'll need to set SAY_DEF_UNICODE in sphere_msgs.scp to 1.
Added: SpeechColorOverride property (players only, R/W) to override client speech hue. This will not affect Words of Power hue, you can use spell triggers for this
	(WOP hue on Enhanced Client will still be set by the client, regardless of the hue sent by the server).
	SpeechColorOverride = 52 (or 0x34), which is the default yellow hue for player speech, disables the override.
	Remember: SpeechColor property is read-only for players and R/W for NPCs. For players, it contains the last speech hue sent by the client. For NPCs, its value
		will be used to set their speech hue.
Fixed: SpeechColor not overriding the speech hue for NPCs. SpeechColor = 946 (or 0x382), which is the default gray hue for NPC speech, disables the override.
Changed: If a hue is not specified, SAY and MSG will use SpeechColor or, if set, SpeechColorOverride.

TODO: add default npc and player speech color as a def to sphere_defs.scp
