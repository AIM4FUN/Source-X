Map is matrix of 112x64 blocks

Each file is a block of 64x64 tiles

Map sizes are width=112x64=7168 height=64x64=4096

XBlock = Int(XPos/64)
YBlock = Int(YPos/64)
Block Number = (XBlock * 64) + YBlock

Blocks are loaded from top to bottom than left to right.
Cells are loaded from blocks top to bottom then left to right.
