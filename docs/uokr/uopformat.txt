(Every Offset value is its first evidence as example)
All values are stored in Little Endian sequence, as usual in x86 architecture.
Compression method is DEFLATE using zlib.

sizeof(DWORD) = 4
sizeof(QWORD) = 8

[1] - General Format Header (sizeof: 40bytes )
Byte(23) 0x0 - 0x17 -> Containing general file headers (Version etc.)
DWORD? 0x18 -> Amount of contained files/indexes
byte(12) -> Unknown gibberish

[2] - Index Block Header (sizeof: 12bytes)
There can be multiple index blocks, they are splitted into chunks.
DWORD 0x28 -> Amount of contained files in this index, max 100/0x64
QWORD 0x2c -> Offset to the next index block header OR Zero
When a index block doesn't contain 100 index definitions, it will be padded with nulls

   [3] - FileIndex Definitions (sizeof: 34bytes )
   QWORD 0x34 -> Offset to start of Data Block of this file
   DWORD 0x3c -> Length of Data Block header (usually 0x0C)
   DWORD 0x40 -> Lenght of compressed data
   DWORD 0x44 -> Size of decompressed file (if it's == to compressed then the file is not compressed)
   DWORD 0x48 -> some hash (filename? extension?)
   DWORD 0x52 -> some hash (filename? extension?)
   DWORD 0x56 -> some hash (folder? because in warhammers-mft.myp this is 0x00 and in all other myp's this is != 0x00) 
   WORD  0x5a -> Compressed flag (0x0001 = compressed; 0x0000 = uncompressed)
   ...this repreats, until all FileIndexes are processed

   [4] - Data Block/File (sizeof: 12+Lenght bytes)
   WORD 0xd7c -> some flag (0x0003 in uokr-myp's, 0x0004 in warhammer-myp's)
   WORD       -> offset to file data from this position (in warhammer-myp's 
                  this is 133 and sometimes 132. so the data block header
                  has no fixed size) 
   QWORD 0xd80 -> UNKNOWN, possibly a CRC
                 (don't think so because this value isn't unique for every data
                 block header. if this is a crc it has to be unique unless there are
                 to equal files inside a myp ... or not?) 
   BYTE(Lenght) 0xd88 -> compressed data
   ...this is repeated until all Files from FileIndexes are processed

repreat until next Index Block=0.


Pseudocode:

[1] - General Format Header (sizeof: 40bytes )

while ( repreatindex ) do
   [2] - Index Block Header (sizeof: 12bytes)

   while ( indexfilenumber~=indexfilecounter ) do
      [3] - FileIndex Definitions (sizeof: 34bytes )
   end
   while ( indexfilenumber~=indexfilecounter ) do
      [4] - Data Block/File (sizeof: 12+Lenght bytes)
   end
end
