-Fixed: New ships were using t_multi and not t_ship. I assume this might have been causing some of the alleged "bugs" with them. They
 are now all using t_ship.

09-01-2014, RanXerox (Script pack)
-Fixed some duplicate itemdef and defnames

10-01-2014, XuN
Changed: MaxFood is now writable.
Added @TradeCreate trigger for chars, fired after trade windows are created:
	SRC=The other player.
	Argo=Item wich starts the trade.
	return 1 stops the trade.
Added @DropOn_Trade trigger for items:
	Act=item adding to trade window.
	Argo=Other player.
	return 1 blocks the placement.
Added @TradeClose trigger for chars, fired before a trade window is being closed (Opossed to @TradeAccepted).
	SRC=The char closing the trade window.
Fixed: Players can now open their containers while placed on trade windows (still cannot pickup items from them, nor them).
Change: Players used to be able to open the containers of other players while they were inside a trade window, these behaviour is now controled in sphere.ini.
Added: Ini option 'TradeWindowSnooping' to handle this behaviour: 0 will open the bags, 1 will call for snooping (or deny it by your scripts).
Notes:	-For now there's still a issue causing the client to crash while someone with a trade window open closes his client or just logs off.
		-invisible (hidden) players can open trade windows to another players (but only first player will see it, this behaviour will remain, it can be fixed with @TradeCreate).

11-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2258: Some properties returning as hex instead of decimal.

12-01-2014, XuN
Change in @TradeClose:
	Src is the player closing the window.
	Argo is the other player.
Fixed: Items being able to move while inside a container inside a trade window.
Fixed: Containers on the ground not being able to open.
Changed: Ships work again in Lost Lands.
Fixed: Disconnect not working correctly with trysrv in high privileged characters.
Added: return 1 to f_onchar_create, it blocks the creation and disconnects the client.

13-01-2014, XuN
Removed: tag.override.noto.$uid, having one tag per 1 character viewing this is insane.
Added: @NotoSend, this trigger will override the default color for status bar and character 'mouse hovering' color (Replacement for tag.override.noto.$uid)
	src=The player viewing this char
	argn1=bar/char color (0 will let the default system run)
Note: The first 7 colors are the same as NOTO_* definitions, but you can use all your hues range (however the colors does not display like in items/chars)

15-01-2014, XuN
Fixed: Items being able to move inside containers placed in trade windows (semi-fixed before)
Fixed: Gold function now updates automatically the status bar.
Fixed: Move back the character data before f_onchar_create to be able to read it again.
Added: @SeeHidden trigger (Heavy load, keep it clean) fired when a char is going to see (or not) an invisible character (just like staff see other staff members while invisible)
	argn1=Invisible/Visible (but grayed out)
	No returns for this trigger.

17-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2244: SERV.ACCOUNT UNUSED xxx can now take any functions with the account being the default in the function.

19-01-2014, Ben
-Added #1607: "LIST.XXX.SET args,..." This will clear the list and set each arguments (separated by a ,) as an element of the specified LIST
-Added: "LIST.XXX.APPEND args,..." This acts the same as SET, but will not clear the LIST. It will add to the LIST
-Change: String parsing should now respect commas(,) as a character inside double quotes ("") instead of treating it as a separator (for most places anyways)
		This allows situations like this:   LIST.XXX.SET value1,"value2,value3",value4  to have a result of:
		LIST.XXX.0 = value1
		LIST.XXX.1 = value2,value3
		LIST.XXX.2 = value4
-Added #1787,#2142: "LIST.XXX.SORT args"  This will re-order the the list using 'args' as order method.
		'No args' or 'asc' - sorts case sensitive ascending
		'i' or 'iasc' - sorts case insensitive ascending
		'desc' - sorts case sensitive descending
		'idesc' - sorts case insensitive descending

23-01-2014, XuN
Fixed #2257: Weapons now doesn't hit from Range+1
Added tag.override.SpellTimeout to alter default .ini setting to individual players.

25-01-2014, XuN
Added BUILD function to server, wich returns the svn's build number via <serv.build>, can be used on scripts to keep up versioning and stop the code or do different things between versions in example. (Ok, caught, Ben did it!)

25-01-2014, Script-Pack (Coruja)

25-01-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2266: Trade Window memory not being removed.
-Change: LIST.xxx.FINDELEM args will now search as a string if 'args' is not a number regardless if it's inside double quotes "".

04-02-2014, XuN
Fixed #2273: Crafting skills with skf_craft not working like they should (Note: skf_scripted means the script is totally custom, for everything, so skf_craft won't work with skf_scripted).
Fixed #2267: Items in the cursor (layer_dragging) are now bounced if a target is opened to the player.

05-02-2014, XuN (Script Pack)
Fixed: changed back i_multi to the new m_ naming style in sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp.
Updated Mordaunt's House System to version 2.3.4.

09-02-2014, Ben
-Added: New variable TIMESTAMP to dynamic items and characters. (To allow for server time to upgrade to INT64)
-Moved: t_corpse.more1, t_book.more2, t_message.more2, t_eq_memory_obj.more2 to new TIMESTAMP
-Added: t_forest and t_jungle to sphere_defs.scp to fix ISNEARTYPE problems
-Fixed: <SERV.BUILD> returning date instead of revision number even though revision number is available.
-Changed: Most Interger types to INT64 for higher time support. Tags and Vars also can hold 64bit numbers. This fixes #1447

13-02-2014, XuN
Fixed: Players now become instantly GuildMasters when placing a Guild Stone instead of waiting until first DClick.
Added functionality to the ATTR_LOCKEDDOWN and ATTR_SECURED flags: locked down items should not be able to be moved, decay and be eaten by npcs (and some more default behaviour), secured items have all this checks but not the ones related to pick up and use.

Script Pack:
Modified: Iron ore now requires 0.0 Mining instead of 20.0.
Updated: New update of Mordaunt's house system.
Updated sphere_msgs.scp: Added ITEMUSE_SECURED, ITEMUSE_SECURE_ON and ITEMUSE_SECURE_OFF

15-02-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2275: NPCs walking through multi doors
-Fixed: Targets not removing when using SELF and LAST

16-02-2014, XuN
Modified @StatChange: now is working properly in EVERY stat change, and not only in the stat gain/loses
	argn1=statid (maxhits,maxmana,maxstam and maxfood are checked now too)
	argn2=the current stat value
	argn3=the new value
Fixed some new variables not working.

ScriptPack:
updated sphere_events_npcs.scp: Functions ModMaxHits/Stam/Mana to work better, they also accept += and the rest of operators.
added: sphere_attr.rar to Custom folder containing some basic behaviour for attr_secure and attr_nodroptrade (for now).
Updated Mordaunt's house system to version 2.3.7

16-02-2014, Ben
-Added #2270: summoned tag added to summoned creatures if CHARTAGS=1 in sphere.ini
Script Pack:
Corrected some defnames - i_fruit_cantelope -> i_fruit_canteloupe
 i_fruit_gourd1 -> i_fruit_gourd_yellow
 i_fruit_gourd2 -> i_fruit_gourd_green

17-02-2014, XuN
Added targetcancel function to force closing a target. 
Fixed some new variables returning hex values. 
Added functionality to RegenHits/Mana/Stam, they use the current tag.override.regen_x values 

Moved all @SkillChange triggers to CChar::Skill_SetBase, now every skill change is calling this trigger (as it should), no matter of .skill_name, .allskills, skillgains/loses and skill trains.
Fixed serv.Regenx returning value*10

18-02-2014, XuN
Regeneration Tweaks: 
	-Moved up a check to force stop in this stat, so useless checks are avoided in a function fired in each tick (each lil improve is a win!).
	-Added FOOD as a regen stat (RegenFood or tag.override.regen_3)
	-ADDED RegenValStat variables (RegenValHits, etc) to work as the RegenStat variables but with tag.override.regenval_x.
	-Removed @Hunger
	-Removed weird check that multiplied the regen time *2 if the stat was not food, it now works with the time specified in sphere.ini
	-Removed weird "Bonus" in HITS giving more delay than the default one, it should sustract it to be a real bonus? however, timers are handled in the trigger now and following the default ini settings.
	-Removed tag.override.regen(val)_x: RegenValStat is now readed inside @RegenStat and RegenStat is readed before it, cannot be modified inside without the trigger bein fired in each serv.tick. RegenStat overrides ini setting now (wich is more intuitive when scripting)
	-Added @RegenStat trigger fired after
		-local.StatID=(0=Hits,1=Mana,2=Stam,3=Food). Writable, never higher than 3.
		-local.Value=The amount of points being regenerated (or decreased in food's case). Writable, can be negative but 0 works like return 1
		-local.StatLimit=by default=<MaxStat>, allow this stat to pass the limit when regenerating, or limit it lower. Stats over this value will go down in each tick until they reach their limit. This does not work with food as food shouldn't ignore its limit (0).
		-return 1 Stop de regeneration of this stat, but not preventing future checks, to do that set the RegenHits to a very high value.
		
Added f_onaccount_connect to sphere_serv_triggers.scp, READ IT CAREFULLY, I switched the default return procedure here for safety, return 1 will allow the account connecting no matter you have checks or not.
Added LowerReq to the ReqSTR check when trying to equip items for both items and chars (It checks for LowerReqs on the item and in the character too to substract to the real ReqSTR)

23-02-2014, XuN
-Modified: CanUse is now only an item property, it also returns now values in hex format to work with it as a flag variable. 
-Sphere.ini: Added the maps 2-5 but commented out, added a few missing comments in some flags. 
-Added a check to IsTrigUsed to avoid trigger calls while serv is loading, this will improve load times and avoid several unexpected errors. 
-Removed SKTRIG_STROKE's checks from skills and moved to a new function to keep together all the checks giving more control to skills.
-Added skill_stroke() wich handles the strokes left and sound for craft and gathering skills and also a new trigger.
-Fixed amount of strokes to each crafting skill, they were random, now they have 2 strokes by default.
-Added @SkillStroke trigger:
        Local.Skill=Skill ID. (Read only).
        Local.strokes=Strokes left*     (Read/Write).
        Local.Sound=Sound to make in this stroke if any (Read/Write).
        Local.Delay=Delay until next stroke (10 = 1 second).
        return 1 Abort the skill.
        return 2* Abort the consumption of resources in this stroke.
 
        *Alchemy works different so its working with some exceptions:
                -Local.Strokes instead of going down it's going up until it reach the total strokes count, wich are equal to the amount of resources. In each stroke if no return is given resources are consumed.
                return 2 Its only allowed in alchemy skill, returning this will let the skill continue to next step (stroke, finish...) without consuming anything in this stroke.
-Modified @SkillStart: Local.CraftStrokeCnt is NOT writable for alchemy, since the skill works different and cannot be overriden this way, use @SkillStroke to add more Strokes if you want.
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging.
-Moved some new variables to return decimal numbers instead of strings.

23-02-2014, Mordaunt (Script Pack): 
Another update to sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp, adding new ships and moving their names to m_ too.

24-02-2014, XuN
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging. 

25-02-2014, XuN
Actual crafting skills (Blacksmithing, Tailoring...) now are not handled as crafting skills by the source, instead of that a SKF_CRAFT is required in their [Skill ] (Excepting Alchemy by the moment)
WARNING: From this version a update of sphere_skills is needed (read below) or crafting skills will not work.
Script pack:
	-sphere_skills.scp: Added FLAGS=SKF_CRAFT to blacksmithing,tailoring,tinkering,carpentry, cooking, bowcraft and inscription.

02-03-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2261: (script pack) Hairs/beards using wrong names (multiple scripts updated for this)

03-03-2014, XuN
Added local.Anim to @SkillStroke trigger.
Fixed wrong animations sent in each Stroke (Some are missing?).

14-03-2014, XuN
Fixed #2289:
-Added local.HitsHungerLoss for StatID 3 (Food) in the @RegenStat trigger, this value is still a percentaje and NOT the hitpoints to lose, but setting it to 0 will disable the loss of hitpoints for this character.
-Update: Damage received via Hunger have flags DAM_GOD|DAM_GENERAL|DAM_NOUNPARALYZE, if you want to change it just set Local.HitsHungerLoss to 0 and create your own damage there.

15-03-2014, Xun & Ben
Added support for packet 0xE2 (NewPacketAnimation), wich involves on updating some animations to a new packet and fixes most of the bugs on the gargoyles animations
(Throwing still needs some more updates to see the weapons coming back).

16-03-2014, Ben
Fixed #2285: FVAL returning wrong values in linux.

17-03-2014, XuN
Added @StatChange to ModStr/dex/int/food.
