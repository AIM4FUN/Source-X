-Fixed: New ships were using t_multi and not t_ship. I assume this might have been causing some of the alleged "bugs" with them. They
 are now all using t_ship.

03-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2256: Reworked NPC object throwing..
->canseelos checks now applies to overrides
->changed tag.override.rock to NPC variable THROWOBJ (can take numerical or string ID now)
->changed tag.override.dam to NPC varialbe THROWDAM min,max (can also be "THROWDAM max" for non variating damage)

->All 3 variables are available on dynamic npc or in CHARDEF
Fixed: AMMOANIM,AMMOANIMHUE,AMMOANIMRENDER,AMMOCONT, and AMMOTYPE no able to be read directly from SERV.ITEMDEF...

04-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #1904: EF_WalkCheck causing some NPCs to climb impassable terrain.

05-01-2014, Ben
Added #1638: Defmessages are accessible with <DEFMSG.msg_name>
			->Also not documented but available before: Defmessages can be set with "DEFMSG.msg_name new_msg"

09-01-2014, RanXerox (Script pack)
-Fixed some duplicate itemdef and defnames

10-01-2014, XuN
Changed: MaxFood is now writable.
Added @TradeCreate trigger for chars, fired after trade windows are created:
	SRC=The other player.
	Argo=Item wich starts the trade.
	return 1 stops the trade.
Added @DropOn_Trade trigger for items:
	Act=item adding to trade window.
	Argo=Other player.
	return 1 blocks the placement.
Added @TradeClose trigger for chars, fired before a trade window is being closed (Opossed to @TradeAccepted).
	SRC=The char closing the trade window.
Fixed: Players can now open their containers while placed on trade windows (still cannot pickup items from them, nor them).
Change: Players used to be able to open the containers of other players while they were inside a trade window, these behaviour is now controled in sphere.ini.
Added: Ini option 'TradeWindowSnooping' to handle this behaviour: 0 will open the bags, 1 will call for snooping (or deny it by your scripts).
Notes:	-For now there's still a issue causing the client to crash while someone with a trade window open closes his client or just logs off.
		-invisible (hidden) players can open trade windows to another players (but only first player will see it, this behaviour will remain, it can be fixed with @TradeCreate).

11-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2258: Some properties returning as hex instead of decimal.

12-01-2014, XuN
Change in @TradeClose:
	Src is the player closing the window.
	Argo is the other player.
Fixed: Items being able to move while inside a container inside a trade window.
Fixed: Containers on the ground not being able to open.
Changed: Ships work again in Lost Lands.
Fixed: Disconnect not working correctly with trysrv in high privileged characters.
Added: return 1 to f_onchar_create, it blocks the creation and disconnects the client.

13-01-2014, XuN
Removed: tag.override.noto.$uid, having one tag per 1 character viewing this is insane.
Added: @NotoSend, this trigger will override the default color for status bar and character 'mouse hovering' color (Replacement for tag.override.noto.$uid)
	src=The player viewing this char
	argn1=bar/char color (0 will let the default system run)
Note: The first 7 colors are the same as NOTO_* definitions, but you can use all your hues range (however the colors does not display like in items/chars)

15-01-2014, XuN
Fixed: Items being able to move inside containers placed in trade windows (semi-fixed before)
Fixed: Gold function now updates automatically the status bar.
Fixed: Move back the character data before f_onchar_create to be able to read it again.
Added: @SeeHidden trigger (Heavy load, keep it clean) fired when a char is going to see (or not) an invisible character (just like staff see other staff members while invisible)
	argn1=Invisible/Visible (but grayed out)
	No returns for this trigger.

17-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2244: SERV.ACCOUNT UNUSED xxx can now take any functions with the account being the default in the function.

19-01-2014, Ben
-Added #1607: "LIST.XXX.SET args,..." This will clear the list and set each arguments (separated by a ,) as an element of the specified LIST
-Added: "LIST.XXX.APPEND args,..." This acts the same as SET, but will not clear the LIST. It will add to the LIST
-Change: String parsing should now respect commas(,) as a character inside double quotes ("") instead of treating it as a separator (for most places anyways)
		This allows situations like this:   LIST.XXX.SET value1,"value2,value3",value4  to have a result of:
		LIST.XXX.0 = value1
		LIST.XXX.1 = value2,value3
		LIST.XXX.2 = value4
-Added #1787,#2142: "LIST.XXX.SORT args"  This will re-order the the list using 'args' as order method.
		'No args' or 'asc' - sorts case sensitive ascending
		'i' or 'iasc' - sorts case insensitive ascending
		'desc' - sorts case sensitive descending
		'idesc' - sorts case insensitive descending

23-01-2014, XuN
Fixed #2257: Weapons now doesn't hit from Range+1
Added tag.override.SpellTimeout to alter default .ini setting to individual players.

25-01-2014, XuN
Added BUILD function to server, wich returns the svn's build number via <serv.build>, can be used on scripts to keep up versioning and stop the code or do different things between versions in example. (Ok, caught, Ben did it!)

25-01-2014, Script-Pack (Coruja)

25-01-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2266: Trade Window memory not being removed.
-Change: LIST.xxx.FINDELEM args will now search as a string if 'args' is not a number regardless if it's inside double quotes "".

04-02-2014, XuN
Fixed #2273: Crafting skills with skf_craft not working like they should (Note: skf_scripted means the script is totally custom, for everything, so skf_craft won't work with skf_scripted).
Fixed #2267: Items in the cursor (layer_dragging) are now bounced if a target is opened to the player.

05-02-2014, XuN (Script Pack)
Fixed: changed back i_multi to the new m_ naming style in sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp.
Updated Mordaunt's House System to version 2.3.4.

09-02-2014, Ben
-Added: New variable TIMESTAMP to dynamic items and characters. (To allow for server time to upgrade to INT64)
-Moved: t_corpse.more1, t_book.more2, t_message.more2, t_eq_memory_obj.more2 to new TIMESTAMP
-Added: t_forest and t_jungle to sphere_defs.scp to fix ISNEARTYPE problems
-Fixed: <SERV.BUILD> returning date instead of revision number even though revision number is available.
-Changed: Most Interger types to INT64 for higher time support. Tags and Vars also can hold 64bit numbers. This fixes #1447

13-02-2014, XuN
Fixed: Players now become instantly GuildMasters when placing a Guild Stone instead of waiting until first DClick.
Added functionality to the ATTR_LOCKEDDOWN and ATTR_SECURED flags: locked down items should not be able to be moved, decay and be eaten by npcs (and some more default behaviour), secured items have all this checks but not the ones related to pick up and use.

Script Pack:
Modified: Iron ore now requires 0.0 Mining instead of 20.0.
Updated: New update of Mordaunt's house system.
Updated sphere_msgs.scp: Added ITEMUSE_SECURED, ITEMUSE_SECURE_ON and ITEMUSE_SECURE_OFF

15-02-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2275: NPCs walking through multi doors
-Fixed: Targets not removing when using SELF and LAST

16-02-2014, XuN
Modified @StatChange: now is working properly in EVERY stat change, and not only in the stat gain/loses
	argn1=statid (maxhits,maxmana,maxstam and maxfood are checked now too)
	argn2=the current stat value
	argn3=the new value
Fixed some new variables not working.

ScriptPack:
updated sphere_events_npcs.scp: Functions ModMaxHits/Stam/Mana to work better, they also accept += and the rest of operators.
added: sphere_attr.rar to Custom folder containing some basic behaviour for attr_secure and attr_nodroptrade (for now).
Updated Mordaunt's house system to version 2.3.7

16-02-2014, Ben
-Added #2270: summoned tag added to summoned creatures if CHARTAGS=1 in sphere.ini
Script Pack:
Corrected some defnames - i_fruit_cantelope -> i_fruit_canteloupe
 i_fruit_gourd1 -> i_fruit_gourd_yellow
 i_fruit_gourd2 -> i_fruit_gourd_green

17-02-2014, XuN
Added targetcancel function to force closing a target. 
Fixed some new variables returning hex values. 
Added functionality to RegenHits/Mana/Stam, they use the current tag.override.regen_x values 

Moved all @SkillChange triggers to CChar::Skill_SetBase, now every skill change is calling this trigger (as it should), no matter of .skill_name, .allskills, skillgains/loses and skill trains.
Fixed serv.Regenx returning value*10

18-02-2014, XuN
Regeneration Tweaks: 
	-Moved up a check to force stop in this stat, so useless checks are avoided in a function fired in each tick (each lil improve is a win!).
	-Added FOOD as a regen stat (RegenFood or tag.override.regen_3)
	-ADDED RegenValStat variables (RegenValHits, etc) to work as the RegenStat variables but with tag.override.regenval_x.
	-Removed @Hunger
	-Removed weird check that multiplied the regen time *2 if the stat was not food, it now works with the time specified in sphere.ini
	-Removed weird "Bonus" in HITS giving more delay than the default one, it should sustract it to be a real bonus? however, timers are handled in the trigger now and following the default ini settings.
	-Removed tag.override.regen(val)_x: RegenValStat is now readed inside @RegenStat and RegenStat is readed before it, cannot be modified inside without the trigger bein fired in each serv.tick. RegenStat overrides ini setting now (wich is more intuitive when scripting)
	-Added @RegenStat trigger fired after
		-local.StatID=(0=Hits,1=Mana,2=Stam,3=Food). Writable, never higher than 3.
		-local.Value=The amount of points being regenerated (or decreased in food's case). Writable, can be negative but 0 works like return 1
		-local.StatLimit=by default=<MaxStat>, allow this stat to pass the limit when regenerating, or limit it lower. Stats over this value will go down in each tick until they reach their limit. This does not work with food as food shouldn't ignore its limit (0).
		-return 1 Stop de regeneration of this stat, but not preventing future checks, to do that set the RegenHits to a very high value.
		
Added f_onaccount_connect to sphere_serv_triggers.scp, READ IT CAREFULLY, I switched the default return procedure here for safety, return 1 will allow the account connecting no matter you have checks or not.
Added LowerReq to the ReqSTR check when trying to equip items for both items and chars (It checks for LowerReqs on the item and in the character too to substract to the real ReqSTR)

23-02-2014, XuN
-Modified: CanUse is now only an item property, it also returns now values in hex format to work with it as a flag variable. 
-Sphere.ini: Added the maps 2-5 but commented out, added a few missing comments in some flags. 
-Added a check to IsTrigUsed to avoid trigger calls while serv is loading, this will improve load times and avoid several unexpected errors. 
-Removed SKTRIG_STROKE's checks from skills and moved to a new function to keep together all the checks giving more control to skills.
-Added skill_stroke() wich handles the strokes left and sound for craft and gathering skills and also a new trigger.
-Fixed amount of strokes to each crafting skill, they were random, now they have 2 strokes by default.
-Added @SkillStroke trigger:
        Local.Skill=Skill ID. (Read only).
        Local.strokes=Strokes left*     (Read/Write).
        Local.Sound=Sound to make in this stroke if any (Read/Write).
        Local.Delay=Delay until next stroke (10 = 1 second).
        return 1 Abort the skill.
        return 2* Abort the consumption of resources in this stroke.
 
        *Alchemy works different so its working with some exceptions:
                -Local.Strokes instead of going down it's going up until it reach the total strokes count, wich are equal to the amount of resources. In each stroke if no return is given resources are consumed.
                return 2 Its only allowed in alchemy skill, returning this will let the skill continue to next step (stroke, finish...) without consuming anything in this stroke.
-Modified @SkillStart: Local.CraftStrokeCnt is NOT writable for alchemy, since the skill works different and cannot be overriden this way, use @SkillStroke to add more Strokes if you want.
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging.
-Moved some new variables to return decimal numbers instead of strings.

23-02-2014, Mordaunt (Script Pack): 
Another update to sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp, adding new ships and moving their names to m_ too.

24-02-2014, XuN
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging. 

25-02-2014, XuN
Actual crafting skills (Blacksmithing, Tailoring...) now are not handled as crafting skills by the source, instead of that a SKF_CRAFT is required in their [Skill ] (Excepting Alchemy by the moment)
WARNING: From this version a update of sphere_skills is needed (read below) or crafting skills will not work.
Script pack:
	-sphere_skills.scp: Added FLAGS=SKF_CRAFT to blacksmithing,tailoring,tinkering,carpentry, cooking, bowcraft and inscription.

02-03-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2261: (script pack) Hairs/beards using wrong names (multiple scripts updated for this)

03-03-2014, XuN
Added local.Anim to @SkillStroke trigger.
Fixed wrong animations sent in each Stroke (Some are missing?).

14-03-2014, XuN
Fixed #2289:
-Added local.HitsHungerLoss for StatID 3 (Food) in the @RegenStat trigger, this value is still a percentaje and NOT the hitpoints to lose, but setting it to 0 will disable the loss of hitpoints for this character.
-Update: Damage received via Hunger have flags DAM_GOD|DAM_GENERAL|DAM_NOUNPARALYZE, if you want to change it just set Local.HitsHungerLoss to 0 and create your own damage there.

15-03-2014, Xun & Ben
Added support for packet 0xE2 (NewPacketAnimation), wich involves on updating some animations to a new packet and fixes most of the bugs on the gargoyles animations
(Throwing still needs some more updates to see the weapons coming back).

16-03-2014, Ben
Fixed #2285: FVAL returning wrong values in linux.

17-03-2014, XuN
Added @StatChange to ModStr/dex/int/food.

21-03-2014, Ben
Changed: Character creation to process 4th skill properly
Removed: EXTRASKILL.KEY and EXTRASKILL.VAL from f_onchar_create as they are being properly processed.

23-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed a crashbug in the nighly build.
2. @StatChange now receives argn1 for changes like:
0=OStr, 1=OInt, 2=ODex, 3=Food, 4=MaxHits, 5=MaxMana, 6=MaxStam, 7=MaxFood, 8=ModStr, 9=ModInt, 10=ModDex.

24-03-2014, matex
Fixed a calculation bug in Linux that e.g. had influence on Skilldelays

25-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed INT64 Expression handling.
2. Fixed a bug that occured when DIALOGCLOSE/DIALOG was sent to older clients
3. Fixed a minor bug in @StatChange

26-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed Cooking

26-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed a bug in ASC and ASCPAD with negative hex values
2. Fixed StatChange triggering for Food
3. Fixed a bug in the movement code, when climbing stairs with (BRIDGE|PLATFORM flags)
4. Updating logged out characters does'nt send a packet unless ALLSHOW is on

28-03-2014, Ben
Fixed #2296: Quality property not working.

28-03-2014, matex
1. Some internal values are still stored as 32bit (e.g. MORE1, ...). If they are negative their value
is now given as 64bit hex number so calculations,comparisions etc.. work on these values now.
2. Fixed an issue with MaxFood/Food. If MaxFood is set to 0, when read it will return the MaxFood level
of the chardefinition
3. Fixed: The server now only loads 1 Map, if you only use 1 Map.
4. Fixed: NPCs moving over obstacles when EF_WALKCHECK is disabled

29-03-2014, Ben
1. Uptaded Sphere.ini description for MAPx settings (These are now mandatory as of revision 1834)
2. Created an exception for MAP0 to load automatically even if not specified in sphere.ini (need at least 1 map to load)
3. Fixed another instance of 64 bit handling.
   (Script pack)
4. Fixed #2292: small change in teleport points for sphere_map_points0.scp and sphere_map_points1.scp
5. #2301 Few flag and typo changes done to sphere_map(2,3,5).scp

30-03-2014, Ben
Fixed system tray icon not removing on exit.

02-04-2014, matex
1. Introduced EF_NoContextMenuLOS => Will disable LOS checks for ContextMenu Use of npcs
2. Improved the standard Walkcheck stuff a bit (especially when dealing with landtiles)
3. Improved the placement code when items are dropped to ground
4. Increased standard LOS Zcheck treshold to 20
5. Changed the meaning of MOVERATE and TAG.OVERRIDE.MOVERATE. It is now a factor that scales the amount of DEX value 
   that should be taken into consideration for walking speed. E.g. if you only want 75% of the characters DEX value
   to be used in walkspeed calculations, you specify MOVERATE=75. Setting this to 100 has no effect.
6. Fixed: Backpack closing when items are dropped to corpse. (You can softscript this if you need it!)
7. Fixed: Use 1-Unit comparisons in Distance Checking. We can't use the axiom of pythagoras here because one tile has
   the same diagonal width as vertical and horizontal width. Doing real-world distance checkings messes up everything here!

08-04-2014, matex
1. Fixed HitsHungerloss. 
2. Modified behaviour of DiagonalWalkChecks when dclicking items in reach
3. If GM's add players to a party, the player is now added forcibly.
4. Fixed a possible itemleak when dropping too many items to the ground. (e.g. via newitem)
5. Fixed a null reference exception when DISPID of an item is set to something that wasnt defined via ITEMDEF. (e.g. change an item via set dispid)
6. Fixed an exception when you type 'c' in the serverconsole and have more than 100 players online ;)
7. Fixed a possible crash bug when players disconnect. Fixed players not logging out sometimes too. (this did only occur on VERY rare circumstances)

09-04-2014, XuN
-Added f_onaccount_pwchange to sphere_serv_triggers.scp
-Modified f_onaccount_create.
Both are fire now in each account creation / password change, no matter the source (serv.account xx ingame, via console, .set password...).

13-04-2014, Feeh
Fixed #2306: No lag should be noticeable after f_onserver_save call
Fixed #2293: Sphere should now read packets correctly from 6.0.1.7 clients

14/15/16-04-2014, Coruja (Script Pack)
sphere_map0.scp: 
-Removed: more generic non-OSI ROOMDEFs (huge cleanout) 
-Removed: some more weird ROOMDEFs 
-Added: missing regions for some islands 
-Fixed: incorrect GROUP set on Fire Temple, Ice Isle 
-Fixed: incorrect FLAGS set on Moonglow Zoo, Jail, Green Acres, shrine regions 
-Fixed: incorrect RECT set on Lord Britsh/Blackthorne Castle 
-Fixed: added missing 'region_flag_guarded' on Delucia 
-Fixed: added missing RECT tile on Cove, Green Acres 3 
-Small improvement on Britain and Mt Kendall RECT 
-Checkmate. Revised the entire script, everything is clean, fixed and categorized now 

sphere_map1.scp: 
-Moved: Solen Hive region from map0 to map1 (apparently Solen Hive exists only on Trammel) 

sphere_map_points0.scp: 
-Fixed: Delucia Passage teleporting to incorrect position 

sphere_map_points1.scp:
-Updated to match changes of previous sphere_map_points0.scp commit 

sphere_map0_ml.scp: 
-Moved: temp moved all SE/ML/HS regions to this file. Since it have only a few regions, maybe it's better disband this file and move all regions to their correct map file (map0, map3 and map4) 
sphere_map4.scp: 
-Small update on Tokuno Islands regions 

sphere_newb.scp: 
-Updated all skill to match OSI default starting items and colors. 
PS: Still need a few more additional items for professions (Warrior, Necromancer, Paladin, Samurai, Ninja) -> I can't update this for now, sphere only have support to skills on sphere_newb.scp,
	 but not for professions (it would be great if someone give a little help with this on the source :D) 

17-04-2014, XuN
Moved tag.override.SpellTimeOut to SpellTimeOut.
Changed: Now @Create trigger can be fired on EVENTS too. Note: be aware of the calls order (SkillClass -> added events -> ini -> chardef (for chars)),
		you can't retrieve the <str> ie in a custom event because it's fired before the @Create in the CHARDEF (which is the one setting it), this trigger
		doesn't have return 1 so if you set str=15 in your event it will be overwrited with the stat given in the chardef.

Changed all the variables in the 'New Variables' thread to make them readable not only from items/chars but from their BaseDef. That means, no need of IncreaseSwingSpeed
		under the @Create, you can set them like the NAME property. Added some variables too, read the post.

Script Pack:
Updated some scripts to reflect the variable's changes:
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts.scp
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts_minor.scp
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts_tokuno.scp
		-items/sphere_item_magic_jewelry.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_clothing.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_jewelry.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_shields.scp
		-items/sphere_item_resources.scp
		-items/sphere_item_typedef_equipitem.scp
		-npcs/sphere_monsters.scp
		-npcs/sphere_monsters_custom.scp

sphere_item_vegetation.scp: Commented out TDATA3=i_vanilla_bean since it does not exist.

sphere_item_provisions_deeds.scp:
		-Fixed line 64: RESOURCES=i_deed,m_stone_and_plaster_house.
		-Changed all of the remaining i_multi_foundation_* to m_foundation_*.

sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp: changed all i_leather from gargoyle leather armor to i_hides_cut (lines 4704 - 5000).

For a complete change's track visit http://scripts.spherecommunity.net/

18-04-2014, XuN
-Fixed a Typo in sphere_item_typedef_equipitem.scp (SeldRepair -> SelfRepair)
-Updated sphere_monsters.scp to add stats to c_tiger and changed changed actual c_tiger to c_tigress
-Added item 03ec7 to sphere_item_ship_parts.scp to link it with c_tiger
-Updated sphere_defs.scp to reflect c_tiger and c_tigress as mounts.

19-04-2014, Ben
Changed: CANUSE flags can now be properly set on ITEMDEF and dynamic items (ITEMDEFs value is given to dynamic items on creation)
Fixed 1565: Removed TAG.OVERRIDE.RANGE from items and chars.
			Changed RANGE so it can be read/write on items and char (Dynamic object value overrides basedef value. Highest value between weapon and char is used in combat)
			RANGEH and RANGEL are also available as readonly variables for dynamic items and char now
			Added FIGHTRANGE to chars to replace old RANGE (readonly and returns the highest value used for combat)

19-04-2014, XuN
-Fixed 0002310: Changed t_weapon_bow in Throwing Items (sphere_item_provisions_weapons.scp) to t_weapon_throwing.
-Fixed 0002309: Mounted characters (humans & elfs) are not sending New Animation packet anymore.
-Fixed 0002294: Every CAN-related property (dye, enchant, flip...) is now working in base items instead of inheriting from DispID.
-Some internal changes related to IsHuman: changed it to IsPlayableCharacter and splitted it into IsHuman || IsElf || IsGargoyle and changed its calls.
	-Same for IsHumanID -> IsPlayableID = (IsHumanID || IsElfID || IsGargoyleID)
	-Fixed: Gargoyles are no longer able to ride anything.

21-04-2014, Ben
Fixed #2014: memory_aggreived not being set on players
Fixed #2311: t_light_lit not decaying as normal

23-04-2014, Ben
Fixed #1500: Quote causing problems for ARGS and ARGV. This is how is will work now in a simple function called TEST...
	-.TEST "a", b, "c,d"		Output: ARGS = a	ARGV[0] = a	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST "a"e, b, "c,d"		Output: ARGS = a	ARGV[0] = a	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST e"a", b, "c,d"f		Output: ARGS = e"a", b, "c,d"f	ARGV[0] = e"a"	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST f"a"g"h,i",b,e"c,d"	Output: ARGS = f"a"g"h,i",b,e"c,d"	ARGV[0] = f"a"g"h,i"	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = e"c,d"
	*All ARGV will now show even if quotes are found in first argument.
	*if quotes are found as the first character of an argument, what is found in the quote is the argument

Changed: TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_CLOSE for DOORCLOSESOUND
		TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_OPEN for DOOROPENSOUND
		TAG.OVERRIDE.PORTCULISSOUND for PORTCULISSOUND
Added: DOOROPENID to Items for new door system.
Fixed #2054: Should now be able to make any door work with new scripting options (default still works if no new data is found)
	-Game Item: (if no info here, use ITEMDEF info)
		-DOOROPENID=0676 //ID to change into (no DEFNAME as it's only used for dispid)
		-MOREX=-1 // X position change
		-MOREY=1  // Y position change
		-DOORCLOSESOUND=00f3 closing sound
		-DOOROPENSOUND=00eb opening sound
	-ITEMDEF: (if no info here and on game item, use default system)
		-TDATA1=00eb00f3 //WORD open | WORD close (sounds)
		-TDATA2=0676 //ID to change into (no DEFNAME as it's only used for dispid)
		-TDATA3=-1 // X position change
		-TDATA4=1  // Y position change

-Fixed: VAR,TAG and LOCAL causing instability in the server with huge amount of data. Limit of 2048 caracters has been set.

30-04-2014, XuN
-Added SpellCount function for Spellbooks (Read Only).
-Tweaked Attacker system:
	Added attacker.add uid / attacker.delete uid. Self explanatory
	Changed: attacker.elapsed/dam are now writable

02-05-2014, XuN
Updated house deeds in sphere_template_vend.scp (Thx azmanomer).
Fixed: local.anim in @SkillStroke was readable but not writable. Fixed also alchemy skill sending anim 0 instead of no anim.
Rewrote totally the combat system for npcs ( I may have missed something but it's mostly done ):
	memory_war_targ is no longer used for npc combats (in the source) but is still present for scripting backwards, Sphere now uses the 'Attacker' system and a new variable added to it 'Threat'.
	added @CombatStart, @CombatEnd, @CombatAdd triggers, return 1 stops actions. (not recomendable, the actions will be called over and over obviously trying to start/add or end the combat).
	Attacker system (Added/Changed):
					NPC_AI_THREAT flag variable to ini enabling the use of the threat variable for choosing targets in combat (for npcs).
		General:	Attacker.add uid	(Write)		Adds the given UID as new enemy in the attacker list for this char.
					Attacker.Delete uid	(Write)		Remove UID from the attacker list.
					Attacker.Target		(Read)		Returns the current best target, these are the priorities: Threat -> Distance -> LOS.
					Attacker.ID uid		(Read)		Returns the 'n' id of the given uid (if in the attacker list, returns -1 if not).
		From ID:	Attacker.n.Threat 	(Read/Write)Gets or Sets the Threat of this character against me, Threat is most important factor to select a target. (this gets updated even if npc_ai_threat is disabled, but its not used)
					Attacker.n.Dam 		(Read/Write)Made it writable.
					Attacker.n.Elapsed	(Read/Write)Made it writable.
I'm updating the wiki with this new information also.

03-05-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2325: Corpse with morez > 0 were able to be draged
-Fixed #1781: Rejected moves should not count as a move for fast walk detection.

06-05-2014, Feeh
-Modified #2328: Dye tub now call @Dye on the dyed item
	ARGN1		= the hue value (r/w)
	ARGN2		= sound effect (r/w) (default 023e)
	ARGO		= the item that originated the dye target
	SRC			= who is dying the item 
	RETURN 1	= stop internal dying/sound. hue changes made from script will take place
	This will allow to change Dye behaviour for specific items without having to track the item id from other methods/scripts
	
07-05-2014, XuN
-Updated 'guards' defname in sphere_defs.scp, guards have other ID since long time ago.
-Added exception lines to the new Attacker_* functions so if something goes wrong... errors are more descriptive. Also fixed some exceptions appearing now.
-Attacker.elapsed -1 means no attacker decay.
-Fixed #2332: Range, also RangeL/RangeH not working as it should after the variables changes. Also made them return in decimal values instead of hexadecimal.
-Made BloodColor writable.
-Modified Guards system:
	Modified @CallGuards trigger for players calling separatelly than NPCs.
	This trigger will fire one time on the Player calling guards per each possible target, argn3 is set to 1 if the target is hostile, however if set to 0 nothing will happen, if this is set to 1 the character will be attacked by guards.
-Fixed guards dissapearing after calling them. They also stick now to the attacker system (if defined) being easier to create custom guards (changing how and when are they called will come in next commits)
-Added ini setting GuardsOnMurderers (1 by default), if set to 0 will only attack criminals, if set to 1 will attack criminals and murderers.
-Fixed: GuardsInstantKill now set hits to 1 before hit to ensure the kill, it was acting as instant hit instead of instant kill
-Changed: Moved the instant kill ouside the 'teleport' check, to ensure its using it everytime and not only if target.distance > 1
-Switched 2 checks to ensure that guards are not called on guards.
-Added a check in OnNoticeCrime() to avoid guards becoming criminals if send to attack any good character.

08-05-2014, XuN
Changed @Criminal trigger, now it's being called in every criminal call instead of in OnNoticeCrime(), return 1 prevents the criminal action, argn1 is how many time will the criminal status last.
Fixed CanUse returning weird values when ITEMDEF didn't have any value.
Added WeightReduction to item's weight calculations, so a item with 5.0 weight and 10 Weight Reduction will result in 4.5 weight stones.

09-05-2014, XuN
-Fixed an exception when attacking blue characters.
-Created a new vector-list to handle Notoriety: instead of having 2-5+ checks per second (and nearby character), the notoriety will be saved in this list to reduce a lot the loading related to this function.
-Added NotoTimeout to ini (default 30) to set the 'decay' for notoriety in each character for another one. However the list will be reseted in each criminal/murderer action/karma change/incognito cast.
-Fixed some Karma messages being shown even if the trigger returned 1. Fixed #2297: Trigger's returns were working wrong and any value given to argn1 was not really being considered by sphere unless return != 0.
-Fixed #2290: Now crafting skills cast animations and sounds when starting and in every Skill_Stroke > 1 (1 is the last, note that skill_stroke is called before the stroke ends, not before starting it).
-Removed SKF_NOANIM check after the @SKillStroke trigger, so even if the skill have this flag, it won't pass any value to local.anim, but if you want to have animation for a specific character, then you can write it.

09-05-2014, Ben
-Improved how RangeH/L 'fix' work and making them readable by dynamic items in every situation.

09-05-2014, Feeh
-Fixed #2326: Some mt_* CAN flags were not allowed to be assigned after char/npc creation. It should be assignable anytime from now

10-05-2014, XuN
Fixed #2334. Also forced that any character called to be a guard ( Argn1 in @CallGuards ) have brain_guard no matter what it is really.
Fixed #2333. Also fixing @Attack trigger blocking any other actions too when returning 1.
Added #1765 :New ini setting: AttackingIsaCrime making criminal any character without any damage, only attacking.

10-05-2014, Feeh (thanks to Ben)
Modified: @Dye is now called on more situations on both Items and Chars:
	-Script color changes					(SRC/ARGO = Server)
	-Dye tubs (t_dye_vat) color changes		
	-@Create color assignment				(SRC/ARGO = Server)
	-Staff .xcolor command					(SRC/ARGO = Server)

22-05-2014, Ben
Changed: char's AGE property now returns in days instead of seconds (CREATE is already in seconds)

23-05-2014, Feeh
Changed: Harvesting skills (Fishing/Mining/Lumberjacking) can now pack or place the harvested resource at feet
	Override ACTARG2 on either @SkillSuccess and @Success (remember that @SkillSuccess is called first)
	ACTARG2 = 0 -> Put the resource at feet
	ACTARG2 = 1 -> Pack the resource

26-05-2014, Ben
Removed and made permanent EF_FixKillTrigger, EF_WalkCheck, EF_NewPositionCheck, and EF_DiagonalWalkCheck

26-05-2014, matex
Fixed a small bug in the code that adds a player forcibly when GM's add to party.

27-05-2014, XuN
Changed: new order for @Create trigger in items, now the order is this; Itemdef, @ItemCreate for characters ( if proceed ), TEvents, EventsItem and Typedef
Fixed #2350: Guards working in non-guarded areas when GuardsOnMurderes=1
Fixed #2352: AttackingIsACrime checks making criminal when it shouldn't
Fixed #2351: Murderers never becoming criminal (didn't need before GuardsOnMurderers).
Fixed #2353: Wrong speech color for tillerman.
Fixed #2349. Also improved the Attacker_GetID() functions a bit.
Fixed #1491: region_flag_no_pvp not working fine. Also a wrong SkillUseQuick(tactics) related to it.
Added a new function to removed chars so they are being removed from attacker list's characters of their attacker's list. There's no reason to keep a not existing character.
Added ContextMenuLimit option to sphere.ini defining the maximum amount of options in each menu.

29-05-2014, XuN
Combat target for players will be 'reseted' after attacking a character, instead of checking for the best target ... so it now gives priority to player's choices.
Changed attacker.target also to reflect the changes and return the direct value instead of calling Fight_FindBestTarget().
Changed the way t_spawn_char creates the characters, they are now placed and the spawnitem is asigned before calling NPC_LoadScript() so, both spawn and regions can be read in the @Create (this can simulate a @CharCreate for spawns but on the character instead of the item.)
Changed summon to be placed also before the @Create.

01-16-2014, XuN
Changed @Attack: added Argn1 for npcs to allow modifying the initial 'Threat'.
Changed: Pets forced to attack (kill and attack commands) now adds 1000( plus the actual highest threat amount) to argn1 in the @Attack trigger.
Changed: Pets changes target instantly when attack is called always if NPC_AI_THREAT is off.
Updated sphere_defs_2.scp with m_keep.

06-06-2014, Feeh
Added: #2340 Sectors now do have flags, look at sphere_defs.scp for more info
Fixed: #2360
Fixed: BADSPAWN command was not stopping when the first bad spawn was found

11-06-2014, Ben
Added #2359: REGEN in REGIONRESOURCE can now have a range as argument.
Fixed #1827: Axis strip now works as case insensitive.
Fixed #2307: REGION_FLAG_INSTA_LOGOUT will now work in ROOMDEFs

23-06-2014, Feeh
Fixed #2366
Added: SERV.FUNCTIONS.x, it can display every available function and its access plevel
		Usage:
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.COUNT		- Return how many functions are available in your server
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.32			- Return the 33th function (zero-based)
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.32.PLEVEL	- Return the minimum access plevel to use this function
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.add1			- Return the minimum access plevel to use 'add1' function

1-07-2014, Ben
Updated: spherecrypt.ini with client 7.0.35
Changed: gold will now be taken from pack first and then from bank in a purchase
Fixed #2370: Not being able to walk up some stairs AGAIN!
Fixed #2371: Vendor buy/sell dialogs will now display in the same order as their templates

08-07-2014, XuN
Fixed, Updated and Improved the .dupe on both items and characters:
	- Added new variable's copy for both items and chars.
	- Duping characters now works fine: Stats, Skills, Tags, Items is copied now, by default every copied item have attr |= attr_newbie for security, using .dupe 1 will copy the items 'as they are' without mods.
	- Using .dupe 0 will create the mount's memory (if any) empty, so when npc dies... no mount appears, .dupe 1 will create another new duped mount character.

12-07-2014, Ben
Fixed #2372: Weightreduction causing errors when calculating weight.
Fixed a small issue with updating amount on items.

17-07-2014, XuN
Fixed #2345: Wrong titles for Elder/Legendary Bushido and Ninjitsu skills, updated sphere_msgs.scp.
Readjusted the skill ranges for skill titles according to http://www.uoguide.com/Skill_Title .
Added SKILL_TITLES to sphere_defs.scp to adjust the range for the skill's titles.

19-07-2014, XuN
SKF_GATHER enabled, only fishing will have this flag in sphere_skills.scp, so now @Stroke and @SkillStroke can be used.
@(Skill)Start and @(Skill)Stroke now use ACT as a reference for the worldgem.
@(Skill)Start have local.GatherStrokeCnt ONLY for gathering skills.
Fishing delay is now 8.0 (1 stroke), the splash animation is softcoded in sphere_skills.scp since working with timerf in the source will complicate things a little.
In the 'long and not even started' proccess of softcoding skills ... the sounds/animations (for fishing!) will be added in the skill's triggers.
Return 1 in @Stroke will fire @Abort.
Added RANGE for gathering skills determining the max distance for the proccess (added RANGE=4 for fishing in sphere_skills.scp)
